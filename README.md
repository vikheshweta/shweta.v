1. Project Name:
    a. SimpleCalculator.java
    b. Palindrome.java
    c. SimpleBankingSystem.java
2.  Introduction:
   a. SimpleCalculator.java
            SimpleCalculator.java is a Java program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input numbers and choose from a selection of operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves as a starting point for understanding Java programming concepts such as methods, user input, and conditional statements.

   b. Palindrome.java
            Palindrome.java is a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). This project demonstrates string manipulation in Java and serves as an educational tool for understanding algorithms for palindrome detection.

   c. SimpleBankingSystem.java
            SimpleBankingSystem.java is a Java program that simulates a basic banking system. It allows users to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check their account balance. This project introduces fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Java, including classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation. It is designed to provide a simple yet illustrative example of how banking systems can be implemented in Java.
